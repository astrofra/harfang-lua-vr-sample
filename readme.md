# Harfang Lua VR Example

This code demonstrates how to create and display a simple 3D scene in virtual reality using the Harfang 3D engine and Lua. It initializes an OpenVR-compatible environment, renders a prebuilt scene to both VR eyes using framebuffers, and displays the rendered eye textures in a desktop window. The example includes basic scene creation with a camera, models, and shaders, making it a starting point for experimenting with VR development in Harfang.
